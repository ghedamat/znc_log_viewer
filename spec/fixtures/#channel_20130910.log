[12:24:01] <alexspeller> locks: why?
[12:24:30] <locks> I'm not using AMS, and I had it in assets which broke my app :P
[12:26:16] <mixonic> yeah, smells pretty weird to me
[12:26:17] <alexspeller> You can probably work out a way to have it in assets, by doing if ENV['RAILS_GROUPS'].include?("assets") config.ember.variant = :production
[12:26:17] <alexspeller> or something like that
[12:26:27] <mixonic> AMS being included
[12:26:28] <alexspeller> but I'd just put it in the default group and be done with it, I don't think it will add a big overhead to your application
[12:29:06] <locks> mixonic: makes sense, actually
[12:29:25] <locks> mixonic: AMS and ember-data are supposed to work together out of the box
[12:29:43] <mixonic> meh
[12:29:56] <mixonic> I do not really love AMS
[12:30:14] <mixonic> And do not thing using ember-rails should require you to use it for a presenter layer
[12:30:17] <mixonic> *think
[12:30:42] <mixonic> This is part of the point of HTTP and REST- you have a layer of abstraction
[12:30:51] <locks> you have to serialize your models somehow
[12:31:09] <mixonic> forcing new ember people to use a specific presenter (and one really not that great imo) is a Bad Thing
[12:31:13] <locks> I'm not quite sure what are your qualms about AMS
[12:31:33] <mixonic> really, even if AMS was great I would still not love coupling the two together
[12:31:46] <mixonic> client-side tools should not dictate what you use on the server
[12:31:53] <mixonic> that is a smell.
[12:32:03] <locks> no one is dictating anything
[12:33:16] <mixonic> if they want to use ember-rails, you are dictating that they use AMS "ember-rails is a runtime gem, it pulls in AMS which is not assets only"

[12:35:41] <mixonic> yeah, maybe I have simply mis-understood the comment. I'll look at ember-rails's repo. I've used it plenty of times, and never had it pull in AMS.
[12:36:04] <mixonic> yeah, so it does https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails/blob/master/ember-rails.gemspec#L16
[12:36:34] <mixonic> so, if I use a custom presenter or Grape or ROAR or anything else
[12:37:04] <mixonic> I cannot use ember-rail without a) mucking up the controller rendering pipeline with it's logic and b) loading AMS into memory to do nothing at all

[12:38:26] <locks> your argument that AMS doesn't belong in the gem might be valid, depending on the goal of the gem
[12:38:26] <mixonic> look: ember-rails (used to be/implies that is is) only about adding a client-side javascript framework to your build pipeline.

[12:39:21] <locks> only a maintainer can weight in on that

[12:47:58] <alexspeller> I think it's a reasonable proposition that "There should be a gem that's just the asset pipeline, and doesn't pull in unnecessary dependencies"
[12:47:58] <alexspeller> Currently ember-rails is not it
[12:48:06] <locks> whatever
[12:48:07] <alexspeller> But I do think it's bad that AMS is a dependency, because that's technically a lie - it's not a dependency. The code will run fine without it. It's a suggested library

[12:50:22] <rwjblue> I've had thoughts of an Ember IRC client for a while...
[12:50:22] <alexspeller> built in logs, basically "IRC but with the things people like about campfire, but better"
[12:50:22] <alexspeller> ETA a few weeks
[12:50:54] <rwjblue> alexspeller: Sweet. I've got a bot that I helped write for our local RUG that I was gonna repurpose

[13:12:31] <wycats> Why do they need queryParams but not params?
[13:12:34] <wycats> Seems odd
[13:15:01] <alexspeller> The way I've looked at it conceptually is that "params serialize/deserialize to model loading info" wheras "queryParams serialize / deserialize to metadata"

[13:17:17] <alexspeller> In afterModel you may want to redirect based on queryParams and model. E.g. if post.get('private') && !queryParams.authToken (obviously that shouldn't be your security model but you get the ida)

[14:28:02] <mixonic> hjdivad_ I'm still concerned about https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/3332. ssured mentioned that it may be intentional that array CPs are not sync? Is that the current thinking? Feels pretty un-intuitive at first blush.
[14:28:03] <hjdivad_> filter treats them as static and sort treats them as dynamic
[14:28:23] * mixonic patiently waits his turn as hjdivad_ is flooded with chats
[14:30:33] <ssured> hjdivad_: when I put my Ember hat on I think there is no choice. All values should be treated dynamic, unless impossible (regular object) or explicitly specified as static. Being dynamic with no surprises is what Ember makes Ember imho
[14:30:41] <hjdivad_> mixonic: it is only the last case that is async yes?
[14:30:46] <hjdivad_> this is because invalidation is async
[14:31:14] <hjdivad_> invalidation is only done in the standard macros min and max

[14:32:32] <hjdivad_> invalidations async
[14:32:37] <hjdivad_> but ALSO item property changes async
[14:32:43] <hjdivad_> because they are coalesced

[14:41:50] <rwjblue> I'm finding their site to be somewhat cryptic
[14:42:34] <rwjblue> I don't know why they don't have any examples of JS projects using QUnit on Ruby :)
[14:42:40] <rwjblue> Seems so normal
[14:43:46] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: i don't know how to do this in ruby sadly

[14:44:21] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: https://github.com/tildeio/oasis.js/blob/master/package.json
[14:44:32] <hjdivad_> worst case you can look at grunt-saucelabs-connect
[14:44:37] <hjdivad_> which is just a wrapper around the jar
[14:44:49] <hjdivad_> but yes it is crazy there is not a copy-paste-modify on saucelabs for this
[14:47:47] <rwjblue> So basically you run a java command and it tunnels back to your site?
[14:47:54] <rwjblue> Or am I just completely missing the point
[14:47:56] <hjdivad_> yes exactly
[14:48:14] <hjdivad_> you start your server locally, run sauce-connect, then use the tunnel to control a remote browser once the vm has started

About the array CP properties you said: I meant only that when filtering against a set of values and when sorting by some set of properties, you have the same choice: do you treat the values as static or dynamic
[14:48:39] <rwjblue> OK, so how do you get a final pass/fail at the end?

[14:49:03] <hjdivad_> ssured: i think we should have different macros to support both
[14:49:10] <hjdivad_> a cost of the dynamic approach is you need another level of indirection
[14:49:19] <hjdivad_> because you need a property just to tell you what properties to sort/filter
[14:49:29] <hjdivad_> but i totally agree dynamic would have been a better fallback than static

[14:50:48] <hjdivad_> ssured: of the macros... you can totally do this with `Ember.reduceComputed` and `Ember.arrayComputed`
[14:50:56] <hjdivad_> we just don't have macros for the dynamic filter case
[14:51:05] <hjdivad_> but almost all of the hard work is in the primitive
[14:51:08] <rwjblue> I'm thinking a redis queue (sidekiq from ruby-land) with X-workers at a time.
[14:51:29] <ssured> I know that its possible with reduceComputed and arrayComputed, but I think that thats too hard for most people
[14:53:07] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: it looks like the way to do this is to inject js

[15:35:07] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: Thanks for pointing me to the grunt-saucelabs stuff. I *think* that we can use that. All we need ruby for is the build step itself. This project could be a node project (which would mean I could just use grunt-saucelabs).
[15:35:17] <rwjblue> 1) Does that make sense?
[15:35:51] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: yes this seems totally 100% reasonable
[15:36:05] <rwjblue> Or at least the runners would be node
[15:36:06] <hjdivad_> the only downside is that it increases the number of tools used in ember-dev
[15:36:17] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: I think this is another project
[15:36:18] <hjdivad_> so maybe makes contributing a little more difficult
[15:36:29] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: ah okay right
[15:36:30] <rwjblue> ember-dev would learn how to 'build insecure'
[15:36:31] <hjdivad_> in that case
[15:36:33] <rwjblue> or something
[15:36:38] <hjdivad_> in that case use grunt
[15:36:43] <hjdivad_> and steal the config from oasis
[15:36:46] <rwjblue> Yep
[15:36:49] <hjdivad_> will be way easier
[15:37:02] <hjdivad_> this will get us to a first draft
[15:37:07] <hjdivad_> we will want to change it to cycle keys
[15:37:17] <hjdivad_> because right now oasis builds suck if too many go off at once
[15:37:23] <hjdivad_> this only works okay because the activity is low enough
[15:37:27] <hjdivad_> for ember this will make us very sad
[15:37:32] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: I am thinking redis backed queue
[15:37:37] <hjdivad_> that's fine
[15:37:45] <rwjblue> Then only pop X at a time
[15:37:49] <hjdivad_> yes exactly
[15:39:25] <rwjblue> So the github hook just adds an item to the redis queue to build the artifacts (insecure.emberjs.com bucket perhaps?)
[15:39:51] <hjdivad_> yeah
[15:39:52] <rwjblue> Then we have another process popping items X at a time
[15:40:02] <hjdivad_> and that process needs to know what sauce keys are in use
[15:40:09] <hjdivad_> and to wait if it can't find an available key to use
[15:40:28] <hjdivad_> the thing is, the subaccount keys are totally unrelated to the workers
[15:40:29] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: I think we could also use redis for that
[15:40:36] <hjdivad_> so i don't know if sauce even cares if we just have like 100 keys and let them do the queueing
[15:40:45] <rwjblue> Wait why are the subaccounts unrelated?
[15:40:54] <hjdivad_> subaccounts have different keys
[15:40:59] <hjdivad_> but they share a pool of workers
[15:41:07] <rwjblue> Right so 1 worker == 1 subaccount right?
[15:41:07] <hjdivad_> so jobs will still be queued on the sauce end
[15:41:11] <hjdivad_> deny
[15:41:14] <rwjblue> GRRRRR
[15:41:19] <hjdivad_> they are totally separate things
[15:41:32] <hjdivad_> because you can use subaccounts to, for instance, invite people to use your sauce account
[15:41:33] * rwjblue grumbles
[15:41:37] <hjdivad_> but you don't get more workers by doing this
[15:41:40] <rwjblue> Ok I see
[15:41:44] <hjdivad_> you just get a new key someone else can use
[15:41:48] <wycats> What have I missed?
[15:41:49] <rwjblue> So do we even need subaccounts for this?
[15:42:00] <hjdivad_> yes
[15:42:03] <hjdivad_> because of a different issue
[15:42:15] <hjdivad_> you cannot have two tunnels (eg for two different builds) using the same key at the same time
[15:42:16] <rwjblue> wycats: Just chatting about the SauceLabs stuff
[15:42:29] <hjdivad_> i don't know why you can't, but i suspect it's something like you wind up with two builds controlling the same browser
[15:42:47] <rwjblue> so we do need 1 subaccount per worker (for the tunneling)
[15:43:11] <rwjblue> But that doesn't == the number of concurrent runs?

[15:44:15] <rwjblue> I'm going to totally ghetto hack something together today/tomorrow and maybe we could chat (not IRC) to make sure I'm on the right track
[15:44:27] <rwjblue> Also, I'm not sure how to test drive this process
[15:45:02] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: it's a little more complicated.  Keep in mind each build will run the suite multiple times
[15:45:12] <hjdivad_> you need a subaccount (ie a key) per concurrent build
[15:45:14] <hjdivad_> but NOT per worker
[15:45:23] <hjdivad_> using one key you can have multiple workers for the same build
[15:45:30] <hjdivad_> what you cannot do is have multiple builds use the same key
[15:45:42] <hjdivad_> I don't believe this is a fundamental problem: ie i think sauce could fix this restriction
[15:45:43] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: OK and that is because of the tunnels?
[15:45:48] <hjdivad_> it is a totally nonobvious restriction

[15:45:52] <rwjblue> Ahh, OK
[15:45:59] <hjdivad_> it might even be a problem specifically with sauce-connect
[15:46:11] <rwjblue> So 1 worker runs tests on say 5 browsers concurrently
[15:46:19] <rwjblue> ?
[15:46:22] *** Joins: javascriptjedi (~javascrip@97.75.169.254)
[15:46:22] <hjdivad_> no
[15:46:33] <rwjblue> :( Sorry for my density
[15:46:33] <hjdivad_> 1 worker runs 1 test on 1 browser
[15:46:54] <hjdivad_> if you have 2 builds, then need 2 different keys for 2 different (sub) accounts.  They will each use the same pool of workers
[15:47:24] <rwjblue> I think we are mixing the term worker here
[15:47:32] <hjdivad_> by worker i mean sauce vm
[15:47:43] <hjdivad_> which is distinct from a sauce account/subaccount
[15:47:43] <rwjblue> When I say worker I mean a process that we run on our side to kick off a suace run
[15:47:52] <hjdivad_> oh ah
[15:47:53] <rwjblue> I'm talking about 'queue workers' from the PR queue
[15:47:54] <hjdivad_> aaaaah
[15:47:58] <hjdivad_> yes okay
[15:48:01] <hjdivad_> we are both using worker differently
[15:48:07] <hjdivad_> how a miscommunication is made?
[15:48:23] <hjdivad_> okay, yes we want 1 rwjblue.worker per subaccount
[15:48:27] <rwjblue> OK, so lemme try to see if I get it
[15:49:00] <rwjblue> So 1 of OUR workers per subaccount (which will correlate to many sauce workers (one for each browser))

[15:49:26] *** Joins: javascri_ (~javascrip@97.75.169.254)
[15:49:37] <rwjblue> And each of our worker jobs need a separate subaccount because they will each need a separate port for saucelabs connect
[15:49:48] <hjdivad_> yes
[15:50:02] <hjdivad_> which must not use the same key
[15:50:08] <hjdivad_> for reasons that are totally unclear to me
[15:50:25] *** Quits: javascriptjedi (~javascrip@97.75.169.254) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:50:33] <rwjblue> right so from my perspective each of our queue workers will == a saucelabs subaccount
[15:50:40] <hjdivad_> yes
[15:50:42] <hjdivad_> confirm
[15:51:33] <rwjblue> OK so if we get 3 'keys' (aka subaccounts) from sauce each of those can run X concurrent browser tests on that particular build, right?

[15:51:53] *** Parts: GitHub176 (~GitHub176@192.30.252.53) ()
[15:52:00] <hjdivad_> yeah with the caveat that they all share a pool of workers
[15:52:18] <hjdivad_> so if we have 3 subaccounts and we want to run against 5 browser configs and we have 6 workers, we only get 6 parallel builds
[15:52:20] <hjdivad_> the rest will be queued
[15:52:39] <hjdivad_> so we could run one build's configs entirely in parallel
[15:52:40] <rwjblue> But queued on their side or we have to do it?
[15:52:42] <hjdivad_> their side
[15:52:47] <hjdivad_> so from our POV not a problem
[15:52:54] <hjdivad_> it will only affect how long the test runs take
[15:52:55] <rwjblue> OK, that makes it easier for us
[15:53:08] <hjdivad_> because initially there will be a wait of unknown time while the job is queued on the saucelabs side
[15:53:19] <rwjblue> What is the default number of sauce workers for an OSS project?
[15:55:29] <rwjblue> So from our workers perspective it will: 1) start sauce-connect on a new port for a specific subaccount; 2) start a webserver component to serve teh assets; 3) Run the grunt task; 4) wait for completion
[15:55:37] <rwjblue> 1 and 2 may need to be swapped
[15:56:25] <ericberry> rwjblue: I LOVE the builds section
[15:56:28] <ericberry> killer job!
[15:56:31] <ericberry> you and twokul

[15:57:08] <rwjblue> OK, gotcha
[15:57:08] <hjdivad_> but for our open sauce account we have 3 workers
[15:57:34] <rwjblue> And we can have unlimted subaccounts (not that it helps us)

[21:15:16] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: [BUGFIX beta] "the commits" that will be cherry picked are all commits master..<pr-branch> ?
[21:15:43] <rwjblue> Yes
[21:16:04] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: do you handle merge commits okay?
[21:16:09] <hjdivad_> basically ignore them I guess ^_^
[21:16:23] <rwjblue> Umm, I'm not doing anything about them for now.
[21:16:35] <hjdivad_> ok
[21:16:35] <rwjblue> If they were to contain those strings it would try to do soemthing
[21:16:41] <hjdivad_> uh
[21:16:47] <hjdivad_> wait does EACH commit have to contain the string?
[21:16:53] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: yes
[21:16:54] <hjdivad_> or just the tip of the branch?
[21:16:59] <rwjblue> Each commit
[21:17:22] <rwjblue> Although the typical process for PR's is a single rebased commit, no?
[21:17:35] <hjdivad_> okay so "the commits" referred to in travis testing is NOT master..<pr-branch> but only the subset of that range that includes the tag?
[21:17:42] <hjdivad_> depends
[21:17:48] <hjdivad_> it often makes sense to have a couple commits in a PR
[21:18:03] <hjdivad_> in my case, someone made a PR that only had failing tests
[21:18:12] <hjdivad_> i merged that PR and made a commit to fix
[21:18:23] <hjdivad_> i *could* squash
[21:18:38] <hjdivad_> but this seems unreasonable since the OP deserves credit for providing tests
[21:18:47] <rwjblue> Yeah, true
[21:19:14] <johnkpaul> With respect to PR's for bugs, who deicdes if something should be BUGFIX release or BUGFIX beta?
[21:19:30] <johnkpaul> should I Just assume that it's a low priority issue?
[21:20:24] <rwjblue> I think that the ops would tell you to change the message
[21:20:30] <rwjblue> All of these are good concerns
[21:20:55] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: i am going to tag all the commits
[21:21:03] <hjdivad_> but i think it will be more straightforward to expect only the tip to be tagged
[21:21:17] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: Totally doable from my perspective
[21:21:19] <peterwagenet> johnkpaul: if it applies to code in release then it's bugfix release
[21:21:32] <hjdivad_> that will be much closer to the semantics of eg Fix #n messages in github and other issue tracking systems
[21:21:38] <rwjblue> Actually *might* be easier
[21:21:39] <peterwagenet> if it applies to code in beta, but not stable, it's bugfix stable

[21:22:10] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: yeah i think conceptually rebasing makes more sense than cherry picking in this case
[21:22:15] <hjdivad_> in which case you can ignore merge commits entirely
[21:22:23] <hjdivad_> rebasing will accidentally the whole merge commits
[21:22:33] <johnkpaul> peterwagenet: ah, I undersatnd

[21:22:49] <rwjblue> it bonks at you
[21:22:53] <hjdivad_> rightly so
[21:23:03] <hjdivad_> cherry-pick merge commit is a strong indication of user error
[21:23:06] <peterwagenet> hjdivad_: in your case, cherry-pick the test commit
[21:23:13] <peterwagenet> and amend it to have the tag

[21:34:36] <hjdivad_> ah, i think i meant it can't have access to something like the CommentController
[21:34:50] <hjdivad_> the point being that it's not within the nominal scope that gets created when you iterate
[21:35:04] <mmun> maybe it's completely absurd, but i was thinking of an api like needs: [ 'comments:model.comments' ] would instantiate an array controller and fill it with that content
[21:35:31] * hjdivad_ but this is how item controllers already work no?
[21:35:42] <hjdivad_> if you {{#each comments}} with an itemController: 'comment'
[21:35:52] <hjdivad_> you will get a CommentController whose content is the item in comments
[21:35:59] <mmun> what I really want is a referent to the Array controller, not the item controller
[21:36:20] <mmun> {{#each comments controllerName="comments"}} would be similar to viewName

[21:42:59] <hjdivad_> it will just get the value from the model

[21:49:56] <hjdivad_> that enables ONLY that feature
[21:49:58] <hjdivad_> this way my tests run
[21:50:00] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: Right, well you could just tell qunit to run the test prefix you created?
[21:50:27] <rwjblue> hjdivad_: Just make your tests use a module prefix

[21:51:40] <hjdivad_> rwjblue: when i run the tests locally, using rake pipeline and none of the release process
[21:51:45] <hjdivad_> what determines which features are enabled?
[21:51:47] <hjdivad_> "Tests will always run with all features on, so make sure that any tests for the feature are passing against the current state of the feature."

[22:18:36] <rwjblue> Does this need to be updated in the ember-dev test setup?
[22:19:46] <tboyt> rwjblue: c
[22:20:05] <tboyt> well
[22:20:11] <tboyt> maybe not in ember-dev
[22:20:28] <tboyt> i'm not really sure the best place to put it, but basically all that's needed is
[22:20:37] <rwjblue> So just Ember.FEATURES.isEnabled= function(){ return true; };
[22:20:38] <tboyt> Ember.FEATURES.isEnabled = function() { return true }
[22:20:39] <tboyt> lol
[22:20:42] <tboyt> yeah
[22:20:42] <rwjblue> $-
[22:20:44] <tboyt> exactly
[22:20:56] <rwjblue> I remembered something you taught me!
[22:21:14] <tboyt> doesn't matter if it's left in the code when doing release/beta tests because feature conditionals will be stripped out of those anyways
[22:21:35] <rwjblue> So we could inject that in the index.html.erb
[22:21:49] *** Quits: jonasi (~jonasi@cpe-70-113-81-68.austin.res.rr.com) (Quit: jonasi)
[22:21:55] <tboyt> sure
[22:22:29] <rwjblue> In ember-dev's https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev/blob/master/support/tests/index.html.erb
[22:23:02] <rwjblue> You have time to do a PR for that?
[22:23:08] <tboyt> only worry about putting it in ember-dev is that if this feature gets extended out to ember data/etc, you'll want it to be "DS.FEATURES.isEnabled", etc
[22:23:09] <rwjblue> If not I can do it...
[22:23:20] <rwjblue> Oh, true
[22:23:31] <tboyt> but it should be fine short-term (right now it's hardcoded to look at the Ember namespace when parsing anyways)
[22:23:33] <rwjblue> So embers tests/configuration or whatever it's called
[22:23:45] *** Quits: jschi (~textual@76.77.154.9) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[22:24:01] <tboyt> i can do it later tonight but if you want it asap you should probably go ahead
[22:24:13] <rwjblue> Nah, I'm mobile now anyways.
[22:25:27] <rwjblue> peterwagenet do you know an easy way to generate a static index.html for the tests?
[22:25:53] <rwjblue> I could eval the erb template, but didnt know if you already knew of a simple way...
[22:27:46] <peterwagenet> tboyt: could you specify a prefix in the config?
[22:28:02] <peterwagenet> https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/tests/ember_configuration.js
[22:28:16] <peterwagenet> i.e. EmberDev.featuresNamespace = 'DS'
[22:28:18] <peterwagenet> or whatever
[22:28:36] <peterwagenet> rwjblue: generate a static index?
[22:28:57] <rwjblue> Yeah to be able to run the tests without ruby

[22:29:13] <rwjblue> Long story, but I think it would be simple ish
[22:29:30] *** Quits: KendrickVT (~Adium@rrcs-70-60-124-200.midsouth.biz.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[22:29:31] <rwjblue> I wanna static site directory to run the tests.
[22:29:31] <peterwagenet> ah
[22:29:50] <rwjblue> So rake dist then ...
[22:29:52] <peterwagenet> https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev/blob/master/support/tests/index.html.erb
[22:30:15] <rwjblue> Right, so just follow the rabbit hole and eval that erb in the right context
[22:31:08] <rwjblue> Will toy around tonight...
[22:31:25] <rwjblue> Also anyone have plans to fix the test output in ember-data?
[22:32:03] <rwjblue> It kinda drives me nuts. All this times shouldn't be printed (should only print total time once for each package)
[22:32:35] <peterwagenet> yeah, it's very odd
[22:32:39] <peterwagenet> anyone know why it does that?
[22:32:51] <rwjblue> Quint.done is where it's coming from
[22:33:06] <rwjblue> That's in the qunit stuff in ember-dev
[22:33:35] <rwjblue> But I couldn't figure out why it does that in data but not ember...
[22:33:49] <rwjblue> Maybe twokul could take a look when he has a minute?
[22:34:00] <rwjblue> My JS isn't as good as his...
[22:34:34] <twokul> rwjblue: let's pair and talk it through
