[02:25:41] <sjkane> it's got a rough road
[02:25:48] <sjkane> but coffeescript is superior
[02:25:53] <landongn> it isn't though
[02:25:56] <sjkane> ya but it is : /
[02:26:00] <sjkane> way more expressive

[02:26:08] <landongn> there's nothing sufficiently difficult about writing javascript that coffeescript is just magically better at
[02:26:08] <sjkane> way fewer lines
[02:26:10] <landongn> …imo
[02:26:11] <sjkane> ehh
[02:26:15] <sjkane> you need to try it
[02:26:17] <sjkane> for several weeks
[02:26:22] <sjkane> you need to really adopt its semantics
[02:26:26] <mmun> BryanHunt: you would use an ObjectController if there is a natural object that the controller should wrap (called the content or model, interchangeably). If this object were an array you would use an ArrayController. If there's no single main object you might consider using a plain Controller
[02:27:01] <landongn> sj can you give me a simple, straightforward example where coffeescript is truely superior, or just more convenient
[02:27:06] <sjkane> ah
[02:27:09] <landongn> because i've struggled
[02:27:14] <sjkane> concision is where it wins
[02:27:14] <sjkane> imo
[02:27:21] <landongn> i'm a python dev too
[02:27:23] <sjkane> it's empty
[02:27:25] <sjkane> like python
[02:27:26] <sjkane> and ruby
[02:27:26] <landongn> so i can appreciate the semantics of it
[02:27:29] <sjkane> it feels much cleaner
[02:27:36] <sjkane> and reads more easily when you write idiomatic cs
[02:27:48] <sjkane> I'll see what Open source stuff I have I can point out
[02:27:53] <sjkane> I also write a highly functional style
[02:27:59] <BryanHunt> mmun: so if I were building a simple user registration form and using an ember-data model, I might use ObjectController whereas if I were using jQuery post, I would use Controller?
[02:28:03] <sjkane> so I think I am perhaps more anal about appearance

[02:52:47] <sjkane> the comment object has an isSelected state

[02:52:52] <sjkane> but similar
[02:52:53] <sjkane> should I gist?
[02:53:13] <mmun> the important part is that the post can take all the comments and apply whatever logic it wants
[02:53:19] <mmun> through the magic of bindings
[02:53:46] <mmun> there's no global "selectedComment" or whatever stored in any controller, except in the comment controllers themselves

[02:55:14] <sjkane> since you are obv smart man
[02:55:17] <sjkane> components are views
[02:55:19] <mmun> wow ty vm
[02:55:20] <sjkane> views are trees
[02:55:27] <sjkane> ...already
[02:55:33] <sjkane> so parent views know about child views
[02:55:39] <sjkane> and vice versa
[02:55:42] <mmun> here's the deal with that
[02:55:54] <mmun> what if you want to use this application state in multiple places
[02:56:01] <mmun> not so easy if you store it on the views
[02:56:20] <sjkane> itemControllers aren't singletons anyway
[02:56:23] <sjkane> so the diff is moot
[02:56:39] <mmun> yes i see what you mean
[02:56:58] <mmun> lemme think about it some more
[02:57:13] <sjkane> if you need to communicate w/ your system at large
[02:57:14] <sjkane> about this
[02:57:14] <mmun> maybe components are the thing that makes doing it with views actually nice

[03:07:20] <landongn> ANSWER: var self = this;
[03:07:21] <csprocket777> I've tried setting a reference outside the handler but it's always null when I get inside of it.

[03:07:36] <sjkane> .then(functionName.bind(self)
[03:07:36] <csprocket777> well not "self"

[03:08:07] <csprocket777> I'm doing an annonymous function
[03:08:13] <sjkane> the key
[03:08:16] <sjkane> is that you cannot use this

[03:30:54] <mmun> ya
[03:31:07] <sjkane> then iut's generalizeable
[03:31:37] <mmun> I will have to think more about what you were saying re: sharing the state between different sub trees
[03:31:51] <mmun> maybe artificially add a common ancestor
[03:31:58] <sjkane> that's not artificial
[03:32:00] <sjkane> it's fundamental
[03:32:10] <sjkane> you can do it through your already available controller base

[12:54:48] <Dafe> It'll take some time to warm up.
[12:54:57] <Dafe> There's a lot to absorb.
[12:55:16] <Dafe> But the Tom Dale blog client intro is very good.
[12:55:17] <krupnik> i've looked at angular and backbone/marionette but keep coming back to ember
[12:55:24] <Dafe> The basic pattern is there.
[12:55:41] <Dafe> You've got your model/view/controller/template sets.
[12:55:48] <alexspeller> krupnik: also http://eviltrout.com/2013/03/23/ember-without-data.html
[12:55:48] <krupnik> yes TD's video is good but as you say a fair bit to absorb esp for a noob like me
[12:55:58] <Dafe> And you just keep adding a set at a time, and you grow pretty organically.
[12:56:06] <krupnik> thanks alexspeller
[12:56:59] <krupnik> essentially i have a bunch of people and want to have a master view listing all the peeps and then a detail veiw for each person linked to via their name
[12:57:31] <Dafe> That's a good use case for Ember Data.
[12:57:39] <krupnik> my complicating factor is the data is in xml so having to parse that to json first and then work out how to send that json to the views etc
[12:58:28] <krupnik> i'll take a look at the docs on EmberData
[12:58:28] <Dafe> You should just be able to write a deserializer to do the conversion.
[12:58:41] <Dafe> But it's probably easier generally to do that work on the server.

It's an ASP.NET back-end so I bundled all the files together. In the release build, it merges the files together, but in debug mode each file is inside its own <script> tag.

[14:35:47] <FilmKnurd> If I were using the RESTAdapter, then the jQuery promise is encapsulated in the ember-model adapter API
[14:36:11] <FilmKnurd> but if you are implementing a custom adapter, then it's bring your own AJAX
[14:36:51] <alexspeller> Right, that makes sense. Make sure you use fetch* methods instead of find* methods in your model hook

[17:40:18] <decasia> the latest recommendation suggests doing something like Ember.RSVP.all(records.invoke('save')).then( successFunction, failureFunction)
[17:40:50] <decasia> but the problem is, the failure function gets called as soon as any of the saves fails, so if you want to do something like aggregate validation errors for multiple models, you can't easily do that
